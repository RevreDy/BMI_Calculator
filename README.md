# BMI_Calculator
BMI Calculator.

I made this BMI Calculator as a practice to my C++ skills.
when you are gonna extract the files you will have the bmi.cpp witch is the code in c++ and the bmi.exe witch is the actual program.

How to run it:

Extract the bmi.exe and open the terminal / CMD
Go to the path where bmi.exe is located for example "C:\Program Files (x86)\C++"
Run the command dir to make sure that the bmi.exe is in the folder.
After that just run it by using the command ./bmi
